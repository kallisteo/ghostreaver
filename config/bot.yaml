# =======================================================================
# Trading Bot Configuration File
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------
# Define core parameters for the trading bot
# Ensure values are aligned with your strategy, risk appetite, and goals
# =======================================================================

# == Main ==
main:
    # Enables or disables the bot globally.
    # When set to false, the bot will halt all activity without deleting this config.
    # Useful for quickly pausing operations without removing or modifying logic.
    status: true

    # Activates paper trading mode (no real transactions).
    # Trades are simulated and no real funds are used, ideal for dry runs.
    # Allows testing strategies in a safe environment before going live.
    sandbox: false

    # Enables detailed logging of trading operations and events.
    # Useful for troubleshooting issues and verifying execution flow.
    # Produces more verbose console and file outputs for developers.
    debug: true

    # Starting virtual balance in SOL when running in sandbox mode.
    # This value simulates your available wallet funds during testing.
    # Only used if sandbox mode is set to true.
    balance: 1.87688

    # Maximum number of concurrent open trades allowed at any time.
    # Helps control total capital exposure and portfolio risk.
    # Set to 0 to allow unlimited concurrent trades.
    opentrades: 1

    # Maximum number of trades the bot will execute in total before halting.
    # Acts as a session limit to control total trading activity and exposure.
    # Set to 0 for unlimited trades without stopping automatically.
    maxtrades: 1

# == Monitoring ==
monitoring:
    # Determines which DEX programs should be scanned for opportunities.
    # Set to "all" to include every supported DEX, or specify the program you want to monitor.
    # Filters which trading venues the bot will actively monitor.

    # Defines which decentralized exchange program IDs to track in real time.
    # Allows restricting scans to specific venues for targeted trading strategies.
    # Essential for controlling resource usage and focusing on preferred liquidity sources.
    retries: 10

# == Orders ==
orders:
    # Amount of SOL allocated to each individual buy order.
    # Defines how much is risked per token and determines position sizing.
    # Impacts capital efficiency and exposure per trade.
    amount: 0.001

    # Maximum tolerated slippage when entering a position (buy).
    # Expressed in %, here 0.1 = 0.1%. Works as a guardrail in case price moves at swap time.
    # Protects against paying too much if the market shifts suddenly.
    buyslippage: 0.1

    # Maximum tolerated slippage when exiting a position (sell).
    # Usually set higher than buy to increase the chance of closing in volatile markets.
    # Here 1.2 = 1.2%. If actual slippage exceeds this, the sell is rejected.
    sellslippage: 1.2

    # Percentage drop from the entry price that will trigger an automatic sell.
    # Acts as a stop-loss mechanism to cap potential losses on trades.
    # Expressed value is a decimal fraction: 0.40 = 40%.
    stoploss: 0.40

    # Percentage gain that will trigger an automatic take-profit sell.
    # Ensures you secure profits once a target return is reached.
    # Expressed value is a decimal fraction: 10.0 = 1000%.
    takeprofit: 10.0

    # Percentage gain from entry price that will activate the partial sell.
    # Once this gain threshold is reached, the bot sells the defined partial amount.
    # Works together with partialsell to secure profits progressively.
    partialtrigger: 0.3

    # Percentage of the position to sell when the partial sell trigger is activated.
    # Allows taking some profit off the table while keeping the rest of the trade open.
    # Helps reduce risk exposure and secure gains before full exit.
    partialsell: 0.4

    # Additional percentage gain from entry price to activate a second partial sell.
    # Triggered only after the first partial trigger and partial sell have been executed.
    # Enables further profit locking while letting the remainder of the position run.
    trailingtrigger: 0.25

    # Percentage of the remaining position to sell when the trailingtrigger is activated.
    # Provides a second round of profit-taking while still keeping part of the trade open.
    # Works with trailingtrigger to maximize profits in extended upward moves.
    trailingsell: 0.30

    # Percentage decline from the peak price after entry that will trigger a sell.
    # Allows profits to run while locking in gains on reversal.
    # Expressed value is a decimal fraction: 0.15 = 15%.
    trailingstop: 0.15

    # Percentage drop tolerated once trailing is active before closing the trade.
    # Defines how much profit can be given back after the peak is reached.
    # Expressed value is a decimal fraction: 0.05 = 5%.
    trailingdrop: 0.05

    # Maximum time (in milliseconds) a trade can stay open before being auto-closed.
    # Useful for cycling capital and avoiding getting stuck in dead positions.
    # Once this time elapses, the trade is exited regardless of profit or loss.
    timeclose: 240000

    # Maximum number of consecutive quote failures before force discard a trade.
    # Helps prevent infinite loops when price data is unavailable or unstable.
    # Once this limit is reached, the trade is closed with "MaxRetries" reason.
    attempts: 10

    # Maximum allowed liquidity drop (ratio, e.g., 0.3 = 30%).
    # Protects against sudden rug pulls by comparing current liquidity to baseline.
    # If the drop exceeds this threshold, the trade is closed immediately.
    dropmax: 0.3

# == Priority ==
priority:
    # Priority fee (lamports) applied when buying.
    # A moderate value (e.g., 500000 = 0.0005 SOL) is enough in most cases.
    # Lower than sell because missing a buy is less critical than missing an exit.
    inputfees: 500000

    # Priority fee (lamports) applied when selling.
    # Set higher (e.g., 1000000 = 0.001 SOL) to make sure the transaction is confirmed fast.
    # Critical for exits so you donâ€™t get stuck during heavy network congestion.
    outputfees: 1000000
